    Hi, I'm a Master of Mathematics student with the <a href="http://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/">Algorithms & Complexity Group</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/">Prof. Jeffrey Shallit</a>. My research interests include algorithmic number theory, combinatorics and graph theory.
</p>

<p>
    Previously I spent a wonderful couple of years at <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> in the <i>Azure Compute</i> ecosystem, working majorly on cloud services involving <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-migrate/">migration</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/site-recovery/">replication</a> of virtual & physical machines and data-centers.
</p>

<p>
    I graduated with a Computer Science major from <a href="http://iitj.ac.in/">IIT Jodhpur</a> in 2016. During my years as an undergrad, I've been an avid sports programmer and participated in several competitions including <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu">ACM-ICPC</a>, <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam">Code Jam</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/contest">HackerCup</a>, and contests on <a href="https://codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a>, <a href="">CodeChef</a> and <a href="">HackerRank</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I am new to research and my current interests can be found <a href="/research/">here</a>.<br>
    My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number">Erdős number</a> is 2 (via Jeffrey Shallit).<br>
