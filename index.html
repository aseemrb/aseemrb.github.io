<p>
Hi, I'm a mathematics graduate student in the <a href="http://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/">Algorithms & Complexity Group</a> at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, advised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/">Prof. Jeffrey Shallit</a>. My research interests involve combinatorics and algorithmic number theory.</p>

<p>I was a software engineer at <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> from 2016 to 2018, where I worked on Azure services involving replication of virtual & physical machines and data-centers to the Azure cloud. I graduated with a Computer Science major from <a href="http://iitj.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>I try to keep a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/record/">record</a> of things that I find interesting.</p>
