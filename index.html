<p>
Hi, I'm a Master of Mathematics student in the <a href="http://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/">Algorithms & Complexity Group</a> at
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, advised by
<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/">Prof. Jeffrey Shallit</a>. My research interests include algorithmic number theory, and data structures.</p>

<p>Previously <font size="2em">(2016 - 2018)</font> I worked at <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> in the <i>Azure Compute</i> ecosystem, majorly
on services involving <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/azure-migrate/">migration</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/site-recovery/">replication</a> of
virtual & physical machines and data-centers to the Azure cloud. I graduated with a Computer Science major
from <a href="http://iitj.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>I try to keep a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/record/">record</a> of thoughts/experiences that I find interesting.</p>
