    I'm a Master of Mathematics student with the <a href="http://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/">Algorithms & Complexity Group</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/">Prof. Jeffrey Shallit</a>. During my master's, I worked on algorithmic number theory, combinatorics and automatic theorem-proving. More recently, I've developed interests in statistical problems on graphs. In fall 2020 I will be starting as a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Waterloo with Profs. <a href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kfount/">Kimon Fountoulakis</a> and <a href="http://people.math.harvard.edu/~aukosh/">Aukosh Jagannath</a>.

    Previously I spent a wonderful couple of years at <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> in the Azure Compute ecosystem, working majorly on cloud services involving <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-migrate/">migration</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/site-recovery/">replication</a> of virtual & physical machines and datacenters. Before that I was a computer science major at <a href="http://iitj.ac.in/">IIT Jodhpur</a> where I worked with <a href="https://iittp.ac.in/dr-venkata-ramana-badarla">Prof. Venkata Ramana Badarla</a> on network and compute allocation in datacenters.

    During my years as an undergrad, I've been an avid sports programmer and participated in several competitions including <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu">ACM-ICPC</a>, <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam">Code Jam</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/contest">HackerCup</a>, and contests on CodeForces, CodeChef and HackerRank. I've also played <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">CTF</a> style hacking contests including <a href="https://inctf.in/">InCTF</a>, <a href="https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/">Google CTF</a>, <a href="https://fbctf.com/">Facebook CTF</a> and <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/list/">others</a>.
