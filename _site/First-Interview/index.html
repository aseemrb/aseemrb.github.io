  <h1>First interview experience</h1>

  <div class="entry" style="text-align:justify;">
    <p>On 14th November 2014, Microsoft invited the selected few (including) at IIIT Delhi, for final interviews for a software developer internship position, and I would like to share the story briefly.</p>

<p>This was going to be the first face to face interview of my life, so I was pretty excited. The process started with a total of 60 candidates from different institutes of North India. We had a written round first. We were given a problem dealing with linked lists, and assigned one invigilator per 5 candidates to discuss doubts and solutions with them. 7 candidates remained by the time we reached the last round.</p>

<h5 id="round-1-written">Round 1 (Written)</h5>
<p>Problem: Given a linked list with node structure as</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Node</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">Node</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">next</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">Node</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">random</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>where the random pointer may point to any node in the linked list, including the same node to which the random pointer belongs, or it may be even Null, duplicate the linked list and return the head pointer to the new linked list.</p>

<p>(Perhaps this is a very well known problem, but I had no experience with this, so was thinking afresh) I made the mistake of assuming that we are not allowed to alter the original linked list given in input, which led me to write an inefficient solution – O(n^2), for which I had to give another written round.</p>

<p>This problem can be easily solved in O(n) if altering original list is allowed in the following way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create new nodes and insert them after the corresponding node in old list, e.g.<br />
<strong><em>A–&gt;B–&gt;C–&gt;D–&gt;E–&gt;NULL</em></strong> is transformed to<br />
<strong><em>A–&gt;A’–&gt;B–&gt;B’–&gt;C–&gt;C’–&gt;D–&gt;D’–&gt;E–&gt;E’–&gt;NULL</em></strong><br />
where A’, B’, … E’ are newly created nodes</li>
  <li>Iterate in jumps of two, starting from A and assign:<br />
<em><strong>ptr-&gt;next-&gt;random = ptr-&gt;random-&gt;next;</strong></em></li>
  <li>Reconnect next pointers in the new list <strong><em>A’-&gt;B’-&gt;…E’-&gt;NULL</em></strong> and return pointer to <strong><em>A’</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="round-2-written">Round 2 (Written)</h5>
<p>Problem: Given a binary tree, print the outer view of the tree in clockwise order starting from root.</p>

<p>I solved this in two steps, first printing the right view (modified to print leaves so that bottom view is also covered) and then printing the left view from bottom to top. The invigilator suggested breadth first traversal with a marker to store first and last nodes of a level separately and then print them as needed, but I convinced him that this method would work only for full binary trees and not all general binary trees, whereas my method would work for all binary trees. I was pushed on to the interviews then.</p>

<h5 id="round-3-interview-1">Round 3 (interview 1)</h5>

<p>M: Me, I: Interviewer</p>
