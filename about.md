I'm a software engineer with the Cloud and Enterprise team at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) and a Computer Science undergraduate from [IIT Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in) class of 2016. My primary interests are computational complexity theory, data structures, algorithms, writing open source software and music. I spend time on [codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/scion) and [codechef](http://www.codechef.com/users/aseemraj) to keep my love for data structures and algorithms alive, and my open source work (small programming projects) can be found on [GitHub](http://github.com/aseemraj). My twitter handle is [aseemrb](http://twitter.com/aseemrb). I like to sketch and play with music at my leisure.

I have participated actively in some events and contests including:

- [ACM ICPC Asia regionals](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals) 2013, 2014 and 2015
- [Microsoft Build The Shield](http://buildtheshield.microsoft.com/) 2014 and 2015
