I'm a software engineer with the Cloud and Enterprise team at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> and a Computer Science undergraduate from <a href="http://iitj.ac.in">IIT Jodhpur</a> class of 2016. My primary interests are computational complexity theory, data structures, algorithms, writing open source software and music. I spend time on <a href="http://codeforces.com/profile/scion">codeforces</a> and <a href="http://www.codechef.com/users/aseemraj">codechef</a> to keep my love for data structures and algorithms alive, and my open source work (small programming projects) can be found on <a href="http://github.com/aseemraj">GitHub</a>. My twitter handle is <a href="http://twitter.com/aseemrb">aseemrb</a>. I like to sketch and play with music at my leisure.

I have participated actively in some events and contests including:
