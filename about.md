I'm a final year Computer Science undergraduate student at [IIT Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in).

My primary interests are computational complexity theory, data structures, algorithms, and music. I compete on [codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/scion) and [codechef](http://www.codechef.com/users/aseemraj) to keep my love for data structures and algorithms alive, and my open source work (small programming projects) can be found on [GitHub](http://github.com/aseemraj). My twitter handle is [aseemrb](http://twitter.com/aseemrb).

I like to sketch and play with music at my leisure

I worked as a software developer intern at Microsoft in summer 2015 on time based allocation of virtual machines to clients and developers for testing purposes

I have participated actively in some events and contests including:

- ACM ICPC Asia regionals 2013, 2014 and 2015
- Microsoft India CTF 2014 and 2015
- InCTF 2015
- MIT Media Lab DI Workshop 2015
- Defcon India 2016
