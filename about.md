I'm a final year Computer Science undergraduate student at [IIT Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in). My primary interests are computational complexity theory, data structures, algorithms, and music. I compete on [codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/scion) and [codechef](http://www.codechef.com/users/aseemraj) to keep my love for data structures and algorithms alive, and my open source work (small programming projects) can be found on [GitHub](http://github.com/aseemraj). My twitter handle is [aseemrb](http://twitter.com/aseemrb). I like to sketch and play with music at my leisure.

I worked as a software developer intern at Microsoft in summer 2015 on time based allocation of virtual machines to clients and developers for testing purpose. I have participated actively in some events and contests including:

- [ACM ICPC Asia regionals](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals) 2013, 2014 and 2015
- [Microsoft Build The Shield](http://buildtheshield.microsoft.com/) 2014 and 2015
- [InCTF](https://www.amrita.edu/event/amrita-inctf-2015) 2015
- [MIT Media Lab DI Workshop](http://india.media.mit.edu/) 2015
- [Defcon India](http://www.defconlucknow.in/) 2016
- [KDE Conf India](https://kde.in/conf/2014) 2014
