tl;dr: [Understanding bitcoin](https://bitcoinbook.aseemraj.me)

Although it has been a lot of time since bitcoin came around, I never got digging. I attended TEDx Hyderabad sometime last year where we had a talk on bitcoin and blockchains. Then recently [something](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/needham-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-would-have-profound-impact-on-price-but-approval-unlikely-1484254628/) caught my attention and I decided to sit down and understand bitcoin. Hence I started reading from various sources and I am trying to compile all of it in [a set of articles](https://www.gitbook.com/book/aseemraj/understanding-bitcoin/details) for my own understanding and for anyone who would like to understand bitcoin in detail.

Although all the content of this gitbook will mostly be inspired from the following sources:
- [Bitcoin White Paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
- [Princeton Bitcoin Book](http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/)
- [Bitcoin Stackexchange](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/)
- [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page)

But, as I am writing these while still going through the above sources, the interpretations are my own and written in a way that I found the easiest to understand. This is a work in progress, so please [help me](mailto:aseemraj@protonmail.com) shape it well along the way if you are interested.
