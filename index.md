        Hi, I'm a Master of Mathematics student with the <a href="http://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/">Algorithms & Complexity Group</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/">Prof. Jeffrey Shallit</a>. My <a href="{{site.base_url}}/research/">research</a> interests include algorithmic number theory, combinatorics and graph theory.<br>

        Previously I spent a wonderful couple of years at <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> in the Azure Compute ecosystem, working majorly on cloud services involving <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-migrate/">migration</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/site-recovery/">replication</a> of virtual & physical machines and datacenters. Before that I was a computer science major at <a href="http://iitj.ac.in/">IIT Jodhpur</a> where I worked with <a href="https://iittp.ac.in/dr-venkata-ramana-badarla">Prof. Venkata Ramana Badarla</a> on network and compute allocation in datacenters.
