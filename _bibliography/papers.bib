  title={Ostrowski-Automatic Sequences: Theory and Applications},
  author={Baranwal, A. and Schaeffer, L. and Shallit, J.},
  abstract={We extend the notion of k-automatic sequences to Ostrowski-automatic sequences, and develop a procedure to computationally decide certain combinatorial and enumeration questions about such sequences that can be expressed as predicates in first-order logic. Our primary contribution is the design and implementation of an adder recognizing addition in a generalized Ostrowski numeration system. We also provide applications of our work to several topics in combinatorics on words.},

  title={Repetitions in infinite palindrome-rich words},
  author={Baranwal, A. and Shallit, J.},
  abstract={Rich words are those containing the maximum possible number of distinct palindromes. Several characteristic properties of rich words have been studied; yet the analysis of repetitions in rich words still involves some interesting open problems. We consider lower bounds on the repetition threshold of infinite rich words over 2- and 3-letter alphabets, and construct a candidate infinite rich word over the alphabet \(\Sigma_2=\\{0,1\\}\) with a small critical exponent of \(2+\sqrt{2}/2\). This represents the first progress on an open problem of Vesti from 2017.},

  title={Critical exponent of infinite balanced words via the Pell number system},
  author={Baranwal, A. and Shallit, J.},
  abstract={In a recent paper of Rampersad et al., the authors conjectured that the smallest possible critical exponent of an infinite balanced word over a \(5\)-letter alphabet is \(3/2\). We prove this result, using a formulation of first-order logic, the Pell number system, and a machine computation based on finite-state automata.},
