I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by Profs. [Kimon Fountoulakis](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~kfountou/) and [Aukosh Jagannath](https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~a3jagann/). I am a part of the [OpAL lab](https://opallab.ca/) and the [A&C group](https://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/). My research interests are statistical learning theory and generalization in ML.

Prior to this I was a master's student advised by Prof. [Jeffrey Shallit](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/), where I worked on algorithmic number theory and combinatorics on words. Before academia I spent a couple of years at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) in the [Azure Compute](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/compute/) ecosystem working on [migration](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-migrate/) and [replication](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/site-recovery/). I graduated with a CS major from [IIT Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/).

Fun fact: My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number) is 2.
