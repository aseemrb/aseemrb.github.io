I'm a Ph.D. student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by Prof [Kimon Fountoulakis](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=K-SafJUAAAAJ) and Prof [Aukosh Jagannath](https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~a3jagann/). I am a part of the [OpAL Lab](https://opallab.ca/) and the [A&C group](https://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/). My interests broadly span machine learning on graphs and high dimensional probability.

I have completed two internships: the summer of 2023 at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/) with [Jay Stokes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jstokes/), [Mohsen Alimomeni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohsenam/) and [Jennifer Neville](https://jenneville.github.io/) on applications of GNNs in cyber-security; and the fall of 2022 at [Google Research](https://research.google/teams/graph-mining/) with [Bryan Perozzi](https://research.google/people/BryanPerozzi/), [Anton Tsitsulin](http://tsitsul.in/) and [Sami Abu-El-Haija](https://samihaija.github.io/) on scalable GNNs for node-classification.

I received my MMath from UWaterloo, advised by Prof [Jeffrey Shallit](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/), where I worked on algorithmic number theory and combinatorics on words. Prior to that I was an undergrad at [IIT Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/), where I actively contested at the [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/) and several [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).
