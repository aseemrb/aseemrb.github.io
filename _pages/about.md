I'm a Ph.D. student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by Prof [Kimon Fountoulakis](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=K-SafJUAAAAJ) and Prof [Aukosh Jagannath](https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~a3jagann/). I am a part of the [OpAL Lab](https://opallab.ca/) and the [A&C group](https://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/). My interests broadly span machine learning on graphs and high dimensional probability.

I received my MMath from UWaterloo, advised by Prof [Jeffrey Shallit](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/), where I worked on algorithmic number theory and combinatorics on words. Prior to that I was at [IIT Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/) for my undergrad in Computer Science. During my undergrad, I actively contested at the [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [Google Codejam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), and several [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).

<!-- In my free time I [sketch](), [play board games](), or play my [keys or guitar](). -->
Fun fact: my [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number) is 2 with the path [P.
