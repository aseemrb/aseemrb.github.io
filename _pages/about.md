I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by Prof [Kimon Fountoulakis](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=K-SafJUAAAAJ) and Prof [Aukosh Jagannath](https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~a3jagann/). I am a part of the [OpAL Lab](https://opallab.ca/) and the [A&C group](https://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/). My research interests broadly span high dimensional statistics and machine learning on graphs.

I received my M.Math. degree from UWaterloo, advised by Prof. [Jeffrey Shallit](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/), where I worked on algorithmic number theory and combinatorics on words. Prior to that I spent a couple of years at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) in the [Azure Compute](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/compute/) ecosystem working on [migration](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-migrate/) and [replication](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/site-recovery/). I graduated with a CS major from [IIT Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/). During my undergrad, I actively contested at the [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [Google Codejam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), and several [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).

<!-- In my free time I [sketch](), [play board games](), or play my keys/guitar. -->

Fun fact: My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number) is 2: [Paul Erdős](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) &#8594; [Jeffrey Shallit](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/) &#8594; Me.
