        <i class="ficon fa fa-file-text-o"></i>
        <b>Historical Min/Max Range-Sum Queries</b><br>
        An algorithm that solves the problem of finding the min/max sum in a dynamic array, that a range of indices has seen across all versions of the array. Leverages the characteristic properties of persistent segment trees.
