- #### Task placement and bandwidth allocation in data centers [research project]
    - Worked in a team of 4, surveying all of the recent literature available on the topic
    - Implemented the distributed algorithm proposed in this [*IEEE INFOCOM 2014 paper*](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848096) using Python, C++ and the NS2 network simulator, confirming the results depicted
    - Proposed the heuristics and the mathematical model for server faults considering the failed server to be having multiple tasks of the same application. Designed a bandwidth allocation scheme for a new application entering a stable system

- #### Total k-dominating set in interval graphs [research project]
    - Given a graph G = (V, E) and a positive integer k, the total k-dominating set for G is:  
    A set T such that ∀ v ∈ V, some vertex u ∈ T, such that dG(u, v) ≤ k  
    dG(u, v) = the distance between u and v in G
    - Devised a linear time algorithm to compute a minimum distance total k-dominating set in interval graphs

- #### Quick Ambulance [[Microsoft code.fun.do]](https://www.acadaccelerator.com/Home/Events)
    - A Windows mobile application for quickly calling ambulances using Bing map APIs
    - Built using Visual Studio IDE in HTML and JavaScript

- #### [Commingle](https://github.com/aseemraj/commingle) [[MIT Media Lab 2015]](http://india.media.mit.edu/)
    - A platform for bringing together all students where they can create and post one line feeds about technical events having links to the respective web pages of the corresponding events
    - Extensible features include mentioning locations and event topics as hashtags to help implement filtered search, and Google calendar sync for regular reminders regarding favorite events

- #### [Collaboard [academic course project]](https://github.com/aseemraj/collaboard)
    - A multi-user chatroom system with an additional canvas for collaborative sketching by multiple users in a chat room simultaneously
    - Built using Node.js and Express

- #### Other programming projects and scripts can be found at my [*github*](http://github.com/aseemraj)
